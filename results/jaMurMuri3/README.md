# files for jaMurMuri3
* galba.aa.xz - proteins from GALBA predictions
* galba.gtf.xz - GTF style annoations from GALBA

# files hosted elsewhere
* [softmasked genome FASTA](https://asg_hubs.cog.sanger.ac.uk/jaMurMuri3/jaMurMuri3.fa.masked)
* [tarball of RepeatModeller output](https://asg_hubs.cog.sanger.ac.uk/jaMurMuri3/jaMurMuri3.tar.xz)

# Notes
* RNASeq sequencing is planned
* as jaMurMuri3 is a Octocorallia, the cnidaria+braker protein set was used for GALBA
